# WebSocket Production Configuration

## Issue Fixed
The WebSocket connection was failing in production due to:
1. Multiple WebSocket instances being created from different components
2. Missing proper headers for production proxy configurations
3. Immediate disconnection after connection establishment

## Solution Applied
1. Created a global WebSocketContext provider that ensures only one WebSocket connection
2. Updated all components to use the context instead of individual hooks
3. Added production-ready WebSocket server configuration
4. Implemented proper reconnection logic with exponential backoff

## For Production Deployment

### Nginx Configuration (if using Nginx as reverse proxy)
Add these headers to your nginx configuration:

```nginx
location /ws {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    
    # Timeout settings
    proxy_connect_timeout 7d;
    proxy_send_timeout 7d;
    proxy_read_timeout 7d;
}
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=5000` (or your preferred port)

### Monitoring
The WebSocket connection status is visible in the sidebar (green WiFi icon when connected).

## Testing
To verify WebSocket is working:
1. Check the sidebar for connection status
2. Create/update a bot and verify real-time updates appear
3. Check browser console for "WebSocket connected" message
